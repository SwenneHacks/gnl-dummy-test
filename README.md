# get_next_line
A handy function that reads files (on multiple descriptors) line by line.


"The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor. Because reading a line on a fd is way too tedious..." - quoted by 42

Goals
This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

Enjoy debbuging ;)
